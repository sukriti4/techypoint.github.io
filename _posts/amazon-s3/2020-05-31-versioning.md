## What is Amazon S3 Versioning

Versioning in aws s3 means to keep **variants of the same object.**
Versioning can be helpful in maintaining different states of objects.
If versioning is enabled for bucket, Amazon S3 automatically creates **version id** for the object.

Eg -
In the bucket, you have two object with the same key but with different version id

Object 1  - object 1 key + version id(1)

Object 2  - object 1 key + version id(2)

Version enabled buckets can be recovered from accidental deletion or overwrite.

**Note - you need to explicitly enable version for the bucket.**

## Enable Versioning In a Bucket

- Step 1 - Login in to your Amazon S3 account.
- Step 2 - Search s3 on search bar and select S3
