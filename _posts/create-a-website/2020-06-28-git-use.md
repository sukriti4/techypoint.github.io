If all goes right, you will be able to successfully install Git.

You can **install Git on Mac and Windows** using link available in Further Study Material.

## Basic operations -
**1. Copy repository to local system**

Command- git clone repository_url

Eg - git clone https://github.com/vbisht7038/vbisht7038.github.io.git

**2. Push changes done to the repository**

### Now Lets do some changes to the Website

- Clone your repository to local system, Go to directory and run git clone https://github.com/vbisht7038/vbisht7038.github.io.git
- cd vbisht7038.github.io
