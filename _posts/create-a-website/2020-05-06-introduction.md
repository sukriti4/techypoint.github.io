## Other Alternatives

Before coming to this website, you may heard of various ways to create website
1. Wordpress
2. medium or Ghost


### 1. Wordpress
You can use wordpress as it provides User Interface to build your website and there are lot of plugins available.
But for that, you need to buy domain and hosting which requires some money.

I will prefer this option when you want your own brand and are ready to invest some money.

### 2. Portals like Medium and ghost

If you are thinking to start blogs, you can also opt for medium or ghost.
They are free and lets you earn money (need to check whether your country lies in this or not).

I personally not recommend it as -
- it works only for blogs
- if you are willing to make your own brand
- you have to compromise with any change they make
- look and feel of your blogs not controlled by you.


In my opinion, build a **FREE** website(which we will tell you how) and then decide to invest money on the basis of response.
