# Search Engine Optimization(SEO)

SEO is very important for our website search results. SEO tells crawlers about the intent of our site.
There is no harcode rule to get better search results. Google changes or improves its algorithm for better search results.
This tutorial is all about implementing best practices of SEO.

## How Searching works

We have hosted our website and users can search using our domain name. But users does not know about us.
Users search by typing intent or purpose on search engine and search engine shows results on the basis of user query.

So how is it possible?

Google collects our website information by sending request to our website with the help of crawlers.
Crawlers are basically software programs that collects information from website.

Google stores our website information in their servers and show search results on the basis of user query.
Google also consider data other than our website information like users clicks, users engagement etc which improves search results.

## SEO Types
1. On-Page SEO
2. Technical SEO
3. Off-Site SEO

### 1. On-Page SEO
On-Page SEO is all about the content on website. It helps in creating page that helps in finding answers for user query.
It includes -
   - page content
   - keywords
   - meta tags

### So lets start -

### 1. Content
This is the most important part of your website. Your website content should be original.
Do not copy from other website as your content will gets reject.

Try to make unique and quality content.

### 2. Keywords
This tag provides additional information of the page to the search engines. Do not try to add unncessary tags or excessively.
We need to insert **keyword** meta tag for every page. Follow below steps for this
- To Search related keywords

   use [keywords Everywhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com "keywords Everywhere") to analyze related and trending keywords.
   Video related to this is available in **Further Study Material**.

After searching keywords, Lets integrate keywords tag in our website
- Add keyword meta tag in both file - home.md and post.md
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
   <meta name="keywords" content="{{ page.keywords }}">
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
-  Add **keywords** front matter in each post and pages
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
---
keywords: "non veg recipe,non veg gravy,butterChicken,healthy butter chicken recipe"
---
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}


Now go to your post or page and check keywords meta tag in page source.

### 3. Meta Tags
There are many meta tags which tells about the meta information of the page. But not all are important for SEO.
Important meta tags-
- **Title tag**

   This tells search engine the title of the page. Try to keep title short and unique. Eg-
   {% highlight html %}{% raw %}
<title>Butter Chicken Recipe | Foody Blog</title>
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
- **Description tag**

   This tells search engine about the description of the page. Both title and description tag is shown by the google on search results. Eg-
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
<meta name="description" content="Butter Chicken Recipe For Non veg Lovers" />
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
- **Viewport tag**

   This tells the browser on how to render web page on different devices or screens. This tag tell the search engine that page is mobile friendly. Eg-
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
- **Content Type tag**

   This tells the browser about the type of document and character encoding for the page. Eg-
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
- **Canonical tag**

   This helps the search engine to prevent duplicate content issue.
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
<link rel="canonical" href="http://localhost:4000/non-veg/butterChicken" />
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
- **Robots meta tag**

   This tells the search engine on how to crawl or index website page. This tag is mostly used when you don't want your page to get crawl or index. Eg-
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
- **Social Media Tags**

   Tags for social media tell how your website link will be visible to the social media platform. Eg-
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
<meta property="og:title" content="Butter Chicken Recipe" />
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Butter Chicken Recipe For Non veg Lovers" />
<meta property="og:url" content="http://localhost:4000/non-veg/butterChicken" />
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Foody Blog" />
<meta property="og:type" content="article" />
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

Lets integrate all this meta tags in our website, for this we will use jekyll seo plugin.
- add gem 'jekyll-seo-tag' in Gemfile
- add jekyll-seo-tag entry in plugin in _config.yml file
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
plugins:
  - jekyll-seo-tag
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
- now add below entry in home.md and post.md
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
{% seo %}
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
- After doing this steps, this plugin will automatically picks title, description from post front matters
and populate other meta tags also.
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}

<div class="imgCont">
  <img class="object-fit" alt="save seo part1" title="save seo part1" src="/assets/img/create-a-website/on-page-seo/save-seo-part1.png"/>
</div>

After saving changes, go to your web page and view page source by right Click.
<div class="imgCont">
