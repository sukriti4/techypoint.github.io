# Technical SEO
Technical SEO is all about crawling, indexing, rendering and site structure, It helps crawlers to access and crawl your website so that your organic ranking will gets improve.
It includes-
   1. URL Structure
   2. Sitemap
   3. HTTPS
   4. Responsiveness
   5. Website Loading Speed

### So lets start -

- **URL Structure**
   - try to use keyword in the URL. Eg- https://vbisht7038.github.io/non-veg/butterChicken
   - use hyphen as word seapartor
   - maintain structure in the URL. Eg- http://www.yourdomain.com/category/subcategory/topic
   - use short URL
   - avoid complex words in URL
   - avoid dynamic URL
- **Sitemap**

   Sitemap is an xml file which contains all your website links. It helps search engines to crawl your website easily.
   To integrate sitemap.xml in your website, we will use Jekyll sitemap plugin.
   - add gem 'jekyll-sitemap' in Gemfile
   - add jekyll-sitemap entry in plugin in _config.yml file
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
   plugins:
     - jekyll-sitemap
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

   Now save your changes to GitHub Account.
   <div class="imgCont">
     <img class="object-fit" alt="save sitemap plugin" title="save sitemap plugin" src="/assets/img/create-a-website/technical-seo/save-sitemap-plugin.png"/>
   </div>

   Now you can check sitemap.xml at [Foody Blog sitemap](https://vbisht7038.github.io/sitemap.xml "Foody Blog sitemap")
   <div class="imgCont">
     <img class="object-fit" alt="foodyblog sitemap" title="foodyblog sitemap" src="/assets/img/create-a-website/technical-seo/foody-blog-sitemap.png"/>
   </div>
- **HTTPS**

   URL with https means they are secure and search engine gives preference over non secure URL.
   We have already discussed [how to enable HTTPS]({% post_url create-a-website/2020-06-28-custom-domain-for-github-pages%} "how to enable HTTPS")
- **Responsiveness**

   Responsiveness means your website renders well on a variety of screen sizes or devices.
   We created our website design mobile friendly. You can check this on your mobile browser.
   <div class="imgCont">
     <img class="object-fit" alt="foody blog mobile design" title="foody blog mobile design" src="/assets/img/create-a-website/technical-seo/foody_blog_mobile_design.png"/>
   </div>
- **Website Loading Speed**

   This is one of the most important factor in terms of SEO. Website needs to be load fast as user cannot wait for slow website.

   You can check page speed on various website - [Google developers page speed test](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights "google developers page speed test") and [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com "GT Metrix"). These website also suggest what action needs to be taken to load page fast.
   - **Compress images**

      Always compress your images as it reduces image size to significant amount.
      We use [tinyjpg](https://tinyjpg.com "tinyjpg") for compressing image.

      Eg- butterChicken.jpg image size comparison

      before compressing- 3.6mB

      after compressing- 165kB

      Around 95% reduction in size.
   - **Resource Caching**
      Apply cache header to the static resources. We will learn this on **How to integrate Cloudflare tutorial.**
   - **Minify CSS and Javascript**
      Minify means to remove unnecessary data from js and css like comments, spaces, shot variable and function name etc.
