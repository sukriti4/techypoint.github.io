In the previous tutorials, we are using images like ubuntu from the docker hub official library.
There are also many images on docker hub like mysql, jenkins, centos, elastic etc which you can use. But sometimes you need to create your own image for packaging your application so that you can easily distibute to others.

You can create your own image by creating a file named **Dockerfile**.

**Dockerfile** is a text file which contains set of instructions with arguments on how to build image.
For Eg-

Dockerfile contains
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
Here,

**FROM** and **RUN** are instructions.
**ubuntu** and **apt-get update** are arguments.

So lets create an image of an application. But Before building image lets understand the application.

### APPLICATION EXPLANATION
Our application installs nginx and runs it.

Below are the steps to build our application-
- install nginx
- create index.html at /var/www/html
- write text-'Hey, I am your application' in index.html
- run nginx service

Test Nginx server by opening url. Now this is a simple application so lets dockerize it.

### Let's Dockerize application-

- We have created index.html file already.
- Create file named- Dockerfile and its content is mentioned below
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
# - is used to comment in Dockerfile
# Start from the base image and we used ubuntu
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
# install nginx
RUN apt install nginx -y
# copy files from current directory to /var/www/html
COPY . /var/www/html/
# command to start nginx in foreground
CMD nginx -g 'daemon off;'
{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}
Now we successfully created Dockerfile. Here in docker file we just instructed how to build image(our application image).
You can learn in detail of Dockerfile instructions from [DockerFile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder "DockerFile Reference")

- To build docker image, run this command on the directory where your Dockerfile lies.

   **command-** sudo docker build -t image_name:tag_name dir

   For Eg-
   1. **To create image without tag** - sudo docker build -t my-app .
   2. **To create image with tag** - sudo docker build -t my-app:v1 .

{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
varun@varun-ThinkPad-L490:~/my-pro-projects/docker-tutorial-data$ sudo docker build -t my-app .

You can easily see from above output that docker runs instructions of your Dockerfile one by one.
This one by one execution forms the layers which we will discuss in [Docker Image layers]({% post_url docker/2020-09-13-image-layers %} "Docker Image layers").

Now you can see the image created by you-
{% highlight html %}{% raw %}
varun@varun-ThinkPad-L490:~$ sudo docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
my-app              latest              47dd272b02dd        About an hour ago   156MB
nginx               latest              4bb46517cac3        8 days ago          133MB
ubuntu              latest              1e4467b07108        4 weeks ago         73.9MB

{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

You are successfully able to create custom image and you can run this image's container by **sudo docker run my-app**
